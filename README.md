# JPMorganDataAnalysis
My experience at JP Morgan Chase's Data for Good event. 
Our teamed used Python Data Science libraries to filter out which countries would be most efficient in producing crops. 
Through this data, we also found interesting correlations that can be seen in the slide of this repository.
This was an interesting experience to say the least. Met new people, free food, free roundtrip plane flight, and got to network.
